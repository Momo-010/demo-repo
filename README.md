Some Description!
I am tired

What's going on here?
Does the shh only work for the terminal you configured it on?
That would make some sense
But if that's the case then how much time did i waste lamenting on the configurations that didn't work earlier
What if they were actually working but i was just on the wrong terminal?
OH jeez, i'm too tired to think about that now.
I've learnt more windows cmd and bash commands in the past 12hrs than in my entire life
